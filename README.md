###TASK assigned

Containerize a simple app (Node.js/Python/Java) that connects to a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB).

Run both app and DB in separate containers, using environment variables for configuration.

Use volumes to persist database data.

Ensure the app can read/write to the database locally.

Push the app image to Docker Hub.

Use docker-compose to run both containers together.
